# Note 1

```
To get your transits, I need your birth data. Here's what's required:
Birth Information:

Birth date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
Birth time (HH:MM in 24-hour format)
Birth location name (like "Richardson, TX")
Birth latitude (decimal degrees)
Birth longitude (decimal degrees)
Birth timezone (like "America/Chicago")

Once you provide this, I can set up your configuration and then pull current transits or transits for any specific date you want to look at.
Would you like to share your birth information?
```

Can we encourage the agent to be more humanized in its language? Something like: 

```
Let's get everything set up to get accurate astrological data for you.

What's your birthday?

*USER INPUT*

Do you know what time you were born? Totally fine if you don't, we can default to 12:00p.

*USER INPUT*

Where were you born?

*USER INPUT*
 
Let me set up your astrology configuration with your birth data. LOCATION has coordinates of approximately X°N, Y°W, and uses the XXXXX timezone.

# Note 2

How does a user fix their config data? We may want to add some examples to the readme or something.
